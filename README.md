## 💡 **Affordable AI-Enabled Maternal Health Monitoring System**

### 🩺 Overview

Our project focuses on **revolutionizing maternal healthcare** by developing a **low-cost, AI-driven wearable device** that monitors vital health parameters for pregnant women. The system is designed to bridge the gap in prenatal care access, especially in underserved regions, by offering a **portable, affordable, and intelligent solution**.

### 🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional maternal health monitoring systems are:
- **Expensive** (market cost ≈ ₹37,000)
- **Inaccessible** to low-income and rural communities
- Often **reliant on hospital infrastructure** and trained personnel

### ✅ Our Solution

We developed a **compact, wearable health monitoring device** powered by AI, capable of tracking:
- **Fetal heart rate**
- **Maternal heart rate**
- **Temperature**
- **SpO₂ levels**
- **Uterine contractions**  
Data is collected in real-time and analyzed to detect early signs of complications.


### 🔍 Key Features

- 📉 **Ultra-low cost**: Only ₹800 without display, ₹1300 with display
- 📲 **Mobile and hospital connectivity** via Bluetooth/Wi-Fi
- 🧠 **AI-powered analytics** for anomaly detection and prediction
- 💬 **Remote alerts** sent to doctors and caregivers
- 🔋 **Battery-efficient design** for continuous field operation
